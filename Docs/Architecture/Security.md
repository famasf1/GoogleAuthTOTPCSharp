# Security Architecture

*This document will be populated as security features are implemented.*

## Security Considerations

### TOTP Security
- Cryptographically secure random secret generation
- Time window tolerance for TOTP validation
- Encrypted storage of TOTP secrets in database
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Session Management
- Secure session cookies
- Proper session timeout implementation
- Session data clearing on logout
- Session state validation at each authentication step

### Google OAuth Security
- OAuth state parameter validation
- HTTPS enforcement for all OAuth redirects
- Secure token storage
- Proper token refresh handling

*Detailed implementation will be documented as features are completed.*
