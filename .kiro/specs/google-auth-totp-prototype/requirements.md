# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a C# Razor Pages web application prototype that integrates Google Authentication with two-factor authentication (2FA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). Users will register with their basic information, authenticate through Google, and then complete a second authentication step using a 6-digit TOTP code from Google Authenticator or similar authenticator apps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register my account with basic information and Google authentication, so that I can securely access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display fields for username and email
2. WHEN a user clicks "Register with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's Google account information along with their provided username and email
4. WHEN registration is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the TOTP setup page
5. IF a user tries to register with an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to set up two-factor authentication using TOTP, so that my account has an additional layer of security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes initial registration THEN the system SHALL display a QR code for TOTP setup
2. WHEN the QR code is displayed THEN the system SHALL show instructions for scanning with Google Authenticator or similar apps
3. WHEN a user scans the QR code THEN the system SHALL require them to enter a verification code to confirm setup
4. WHEN the verification code is correct THEN the system SHALL mark TOTP as enabled for the user account
5. IF the verification code is incorrect THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login using Google authentication followed by TOTP verification, so that I can securely access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a "Login with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Login with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth authentication
3. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to the TOTP verification page
4. WHEN the TOTP verification page loads THEN the system SHALL display a field for entering the 6-digit code
5. WHEN a user enters a valid TOTP code THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the main application
6. IF the TOTP code is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
7. WHEN a user has 3 consecutive failed TOTP attempts THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 5 minutes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access a protected dashboard area, so that I can use the application's main functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fully authenticated user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their username and email
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user is authenticated but hasn't completed TOTP setup THEN the system SHALL redirect to the TOTP setup page
4. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication sessions and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and return to the login page
2. WHEN the application cannot connect to Google services THEN the system SHALL display a service unavailable message
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page with an appropriate message
4. WHEN any authentication step fails THEN the system SHALL log the error for debugging purposes
5. IF a user's account is temporarily locked THEN the system SHALL display the remaining lockout time
